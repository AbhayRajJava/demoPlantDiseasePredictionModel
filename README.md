# 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
Plant diseases significantly affect agricultural productivity and crop quality. This project aims to develop a **Plant Disease Prediction Model** using **Machine Learning / Deep Learning** techniques to identify plant diseases from leaf images at an early stage.

The system analyzes images of plant leaves and classifies them as **healthy or diseased**, enabling timely treatment and better crop management.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect plant diseases using leaf images  
- Reduce crop losses through early diagnosis  
- Provide a fast, accurate, and cost-effective solution for farmers  
- Support smart and precision agriculture

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** Plant leaf image dataset (e.g., PlantVillage)

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. Image Input (Plant Leaf Image)  
2. Image Preprocessing (Resizing, Normalization)  
3. Feature Extraction using CNN  
4. Disease Classification  
5. Output Prediction (Disease Name / Healthy)
